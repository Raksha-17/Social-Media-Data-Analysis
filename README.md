# Social-Media-Data-Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I explore a simulated social media, for example Tweets, data set to understand trends in likes across different categories.In this project, I will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at a social media agency, helping to create a comprehensive report that analyzes the performance of different categories of social media posts.

## Case Study
Suppose I work for a social media marketing company that specializes in promoting brands and products on a popular social media platform. My team is responsible for analyzing the performance of different types of posts based on categories, such as health, family, food, etc. to help clients optimize their social media strategy and increase their reach and engagement.They want me to use Python to automatically extract tweets posted from one or more categories, and to clean, analyze and visualize the data. The team will use my analysis to making data-driven recommendations to clients to improve their social media performance. This feature will help the marketing agency deliver tweets on time, within budget, and gain fast results. The objective of this project is to analyze tweets (or other social media data) and gain insights into user engagement. I will explore the data set using visualization techniques to understand the distribution of likes across different categories. Finally, we will analyze the data to draw conclusions about the most popular categories and the overall engagement on the platform.

## Project Objectives
1. Increase client reach and engagement.
2. Gain valuable insights that will help improve social media performance.
3. Achieve their social media goals and provide data-driven recommendations.

## The Challenge

My task will be taking on the role of a social media analyst responsible for collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data on a clients social media posts. I will also be responsible for communicating the insights and making data-driven recommendations to clients to improve their social media performance. To do this, I will set up the environment, identify the categories for the post (fitness, tech, family, beauty, etc) process, analyze, and visualize data. In this project, I will use data from Twitter; After I perform my analysis, I will share my findings.

## Task 1:Import required libraries

The first step is to import all the necessary libraries that will be used in the project. In this case, we need pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and random libraries.

## Executive Summary

**End-to-end analytics workflow**: generated a synthetic social media dataset, cleaned it, visualized engagement distributions, and calculated category-level insights. The histogram reveals the overall distribution of likes with a typical right skew, while the boxplot highlights variability and comparisons across content categories. Mean likes offer a baseline engagement metric, and category means reveal which topics tend to attract more interaction in this synthetic scenario.

**Business implications**
- Insights can guide content strategy by prioritizing high-engagement categories identified in the synthetic data.
- The approach demonstrates reproducibility and scalability for larger datasets and more complex features.

**Next steps**
- Introduce realistic category-specific engagement rates, time-based trends, and outlier handling.
- Extend to predictive modeling of Likes based on Category and Date features.
